    # Twitter Taggings

    The data file format is just a plain text file. First item is the resource identifier, followed by attributes to be applied. Any line with leading space characters or empty line is ignored. This makes debugging and testing with a large input file easier to break down in a text editor capable of simple in/out-dent shortcuts. Space between fields is ignored (use as much or as little, s.t. n >= 1 ).

    ## Example:

dothtm  cool_guy    developer
    someone_else    tabbed_lines_should_be_ignored
